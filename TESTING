Interact with the docker API directly with curl or other HTTP tools.

For the JSON results, use jq to format

curl --unix-socket /var/run/docker.sock -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost/version | jq

Rather than mocking all of docker, the tests require a functioning
docker system.  If you have docker running on /var/run/docker.sock,
set ALL_TESTING to 1 to run the tests, otherwise most tests are
skipped.
