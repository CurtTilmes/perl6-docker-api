# Docker - Perl 6 Docker API

A simple wrapper around the [Docker REST
API](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/latest).  Much of the API is
not fully documented here -- it just follows the API.

## Basic Usage

    use Docker;

    my $d = Docker.new;      # Defaults to /var/run/docker.sock

    $d.version<Version>;     # Other stuff in version too

    $d.info<ProductLicense>; # Other stuff in info too

    $d.images;               # List Images

    $d.containers;           # List Containers

    $d.image-create(fromImage => 'alpine', tag => 'latest'); # image pull

    $d.container-create(name => 'foo',
                        Image => 'alpine',
                        Cmd => ( '/bin/echo', 'hello world!') );

    $d.container-start(id => 'foo');

    print $d.container-logs(id => 'foo');

    $d.container-stop(id => 'foo');

    $d.container-remove(id => 'foo');

## Connection

By default, Docker.new() will just use a unix socket on `/var/run/docker.sock`
If you use a different socket name, you can pass in `:unix-socket-path`:

    my $docker = Docker.new(unix-socket-path => '/my/special/socket')

If you have it running on a TCP port (hopefully you know what you are
doing and do it securely), you can pass in a host/port like this:

    my $docker = Docker.new(host => 'somehost', port => 12345);

If you know what you are doing, you can pass in other options for
`LibCurl` and they just get passed through.

One `LibCurl` option that is useful for debugging is `:verbose` which
will dump out the HTTP headers.

## filters

Many of the command have a `:%filters` option.  You can construct your
own hash of filter argument and just pass that in.  If you pass in
other arguments, they will get stuck into filters.

For example:

    $docker.volumes(filters => { label => { foo => True } } );

and

    $docker.volumes(label => 'foo');

do the same thing.

## Streams

Some commands such as `attach`, `stats`, `logs`, `events`, `exec`,
etc. have options for streaming ongoing output.  They return a
`Docker::Stream` object.  It is kind of, but not really like
`Proc::Async`.

It stringifies to just slurp in all the output and return it as a
string, so you can do things like this:

    print $docker.logs(id => 'foo');

If you do that with something that keeps on streaming, it will keep on
slurping forever and appear to hang.

You can access `.stdout` and `.stderr` streams which are by default
merged (and if you have a container with a `tty`, they are also merged
so even if you ask for stderr, all output will be on stdout anyway).
They are returned as supplies that must be tapped to use.

You have to call `.start` to start the process.  It returns a
`Promise` that will be kept when the process completes.

```
my $stream = $docker.logs(id => $foo, :follow);
$stream.stdout.tap({ .print });
await self.start;
```

You can also use react/whenever:

```
my $stream = $docker.logs(id => $foo, :follow);
react {
    whenever $stream.stdout.lines { .put }
    whenever $stream.start { done }
}
```

By default everything goes to stdout, by you can also separate
out stderr and do something different:

```
my $stream = $docker.logs(id => $foo, :!merge, :stdout, :stderr, :follow);
react {
    whenever $stream.stdout.lines { .put }
    whenever $stream.stderr(:bin) {  # Binary Blobs instead of Strs
        .decode.put
    }
    whenever $stream.start { done }
}
```

You can send input to the container (if you use the right options to
attach/open stdin):

```
$docker.container-create(name => 'foo',
                         Image => 'busybox',
                         :AttachStdin, :OpenStdin, :AttachStdout),

$docker.container-start(id => foo);

my $stream = $docker.container-attach(id => foo);

my $stdout = '';

$stream.stdout.tap({ $stdout ~= $_ });  # Capture stdout in a string

my $p = $stream.start; # start the stream up

$stream.print("echo hello world\nexit\n");  # Send two lines to stdin

await($p);  # Wait for the stream to close

print $stdout;   # Dump the string or do something else with it.
```

(Of course for something this simple, you are probably better off with
`exec`, but you can really drive interactive stuff with this if you
know what you are doing.)

## Authentication

Using `image-create` to pull an image from a private repository or
using `image-push` will require authentication to the image registry.

You will need an authenication token, which is an insecure way of
encoding authentication credentials.  (Protect the token from
disclosure like a password.)

You can use the `token` method to create a token:

    my $auth-token = Docker::API.token(
        username => 'me',
        password => '********',
        serveraddress => 'https://index.docker.io/v1/');

You can also just create one manually from the command line:

    echo -n '{"username":"me","password":"*******","serveraddress":"quay.io"}' | base64 -w0

Pass that in to the `:auth-token` parameter to `Docker.new`:

    my $docker = Docker::API.new(:$auth-token);

You can also set it later if you need multiple tokens (or just make
multiple `Docker::API` objects.)

    $docker.auth-token = '...';

It will also use a token from environment variable
`DOCKER_API_AUTH_TOKEN` if that is set.  That is much preferred to
embedding the password in a script.

## Methods

### auth(...)

    $docker.auth(username => 'me',
                 password => '********',
                 email => 'me@example.com',
                 serveraddress => 'https://index.docker.io/v1/');

Validate credentials for a registry and, if available, get an identity
token for accessing the registry without password.

### version()

Returns the version of Docker that is running and various information
about the system that Docker is running on.

### info()

Get system information.

### df()

Get data usage information.

### containers(Bool :$all, Int :$limit, Bool :$size, :%filters, |filters)

Returns a list of containers.

### container-inspect(Str:D :$id!, Bool :$size)

Return low-level information about a container.

### container-top(Str:D :$id!, Str :$ps_args)

List processes running inside a container.

On Unix systems, this is done by running the ps command. This endpoint
is not supported on Windows.

### container-changes(Str:D :$id!)

Get changes on a containerâ€™s filesystem

Returns which files in a container's filesystem have been added,
deleted, or modified. The Kind of modification can be one of:

0: Modified
1: Added
2: Deleted

### container-export(Str:D :$id!, Str :$download)

Export the contents of a container as a tarball.

Specify a filename in `:download` to save to disk, otherwise
returns tar file as a `Buf`.

### container-stats(Str:D :$id)

### container-logs(Str:D :$id!, Bool :$merge = True, Bool :$stdout, Bool :$stderr, Int :$since, Int :$until, Bool :$timestamps, Str :$tail)

Get stdout and stderr logs from a container.

Note: This endpoint works only for containers with the json-file or
journald logging driver.

Note, this sets `:merge`, an additional option specific to this
module, by default to true.

`:merge` will automatically select *both* `:stdout` and `:stderr` and
merge them into a single stream.  If you don't want that, pass in
`:!merge` and `:stdout` and/or `:stderr`.

If you pass in `:follow` it will leave the connection open and stream
output to you.

### container-start(Str:D :$id!, Str :$detachKeys)

### container-stop(Str:D :$id!, Int :$t)

`:t` = Number of seconds to wait before killing the container

### container-restart(Str:D :$id!, Int :$t)

`:t` = Number of seconds to wait before restarting the container

### container-kill(Str:D :$id!, Cool :$signal)

:signal can be a POSIX signal integer or string (e.g. `SIGINT`)
default `SIGKILL`

### container-rename(Str:D :$id!, Str:D :$name!)

### container-pause(Str:D :$id!)

                                    %( 'alpine*:*' => True )));
    .<RepoTags>.say for @$list;

                Str :$platform)

                       Str :$networkmode, Str :$platform, Str :$target)


    $docker.image-build(:q, :rm, t => ['docker-perl-testing:test-version'],
        remote => 'https://github.com/CurtTilmes/docker-test.git')

`:q` = quiet

`:rm` = Remove intermediate containers after a successful build

`:remote` = A URL, can be for a git repository, or a single file that
is a Dockerfile, or a single file that is a tarball with a Dockerfile
in it.  If you rename the dockerfile, pass in `:dockerfile` to tell it
which file is the Dockerfile.

## INSTALL

Uses [LibCurl](https://github.com/CurtTilmes/LibCurl) to communicate
with Docker, so that will need to be installed.  Since it depends on
the [libcurl](https://curl.haxx.se/download.html) library, you must
also install that first.
